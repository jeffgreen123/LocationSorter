# LocationSorter
</br>
WORK IN PROGRESS
</br>
</br>
This will be an application that my father uses giving a set number of job locations, and the start and end of each day
</br>
</br>
Make sure the addressConverter.py and addresses.txt is in the same folder as the Qt executable
</br>
</br>
Input the addresses you want to use in that file seperated by a new line
</br>
</br>
The python file will call a web API to convert these addresses to latitude and longtitude values
</br>
</br>
From this information, the algorithm will find the 5/6 optimal paths out of those locations/starts/ends
