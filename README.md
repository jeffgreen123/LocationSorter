# LocationSorter
</br>
WORK IN PROGRESS
</br>
</br>
This will be an application that my father uses giving a set number of job locations, and the start and end of each day
</br>
</br>
Make sure the addressConverter.py, addresses.txt, starts.txt and stops.txt are all in the same folder as the Qt executable
</br>
</br>
Input the addresses, starts, and stops you want to use in their respective file seperated by a new line, make sure starts and stops have the same size (used to determine # of days)
</br>
</br>
The python file will call a web API to convert these addresses to latitude and longtitude values
</br>
</br>
From this information, the algorithm will find the 5/6 optimal paths out of those locations/starts/ends
